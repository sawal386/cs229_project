Open main.py. This is py file that you will used to run the model. Then, 

1. Add the full path (folder name + file name) of the pkl file containing the data matrix. 

2. Add the full path of the pkl file containing the dictionary that maps words to indices. 

In case, there is not pickle file you can create one. You can learn more about pickle here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html. 

3. Run main.py from an IDE or terminal. You do not need to make any other modifications to the code. But feel free to make changes as you see fit. 

4. So far, I run two model. Non negative factorization and LDA. For each model, I also spit out the most probable word for each topic. 

5. For non-negative matrix factorization, I have also added functionalities to cluster the embeddings.
